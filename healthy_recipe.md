**Section 2: Preparation Instructions**

*Main Dish: Vegetarian Moussaka*  
1. Preheat your oven to 180°C (350°F). Slice the eggplants into 1 cm thick rounds, sprinkle with salt, and let them sit for 20 minutes to release excess moisture. Pat dry with paper towels.  
2. Heat olive oil in a pan and fry the eggplant slices until golden brown on both sides. Set aside on a paper towel.  
3. In the same pan, add the onion and garlic, sauté until translucent. Add the canned chickpeas and cook for a few minutes. Stir in the canned tomatoes, tomato paste, cinnamon, oregano, salt, and pepper. Simmer for 20 minutes until the sauce thickens.  
4. For the béchamel sauce, melt butter in a saucepan, stir in flour and cook for 2 minutes. Gradually add plant-based milk, whisking continuously until thickened. Remove from heat, add the beaten egg, nutmeg, salt, and pepper.  
5. In a baking dish, layer half of the eggplant slices, cover with the chickpea sauce, then the remaining eggplant. Pour the béchamel sauce over the top, sprinkle with grated cheese.  
6. Bake for 45 minutes until golden brown. Allow to cool slightly before serving.  

*Side Dish: Greek Salad*  
1. In a large bowl, combine tomatoes, cucumber, bell pepper, and red onion.  
2. Add the feta cheese and olives.  
3. In a small bowl, whisk olive oil, red wine vinegar, oregano, salt, and pepper. Drizzle over the salad and toss gently.  

*Dessert: Baklava*  
1. Preheat oven to 180°C (350°F). Grease a baking dish with melted butter.  
2. Mix chopped walnuts, almonds, and cinnamon in a bowl.  
3. Layer 5 sheets of phyllo in the dish, brushing each with butter. Spread a portion of the nut mixture. Repeat until nuts are used, finishing with 5 phyllo sheets on top, brushing each with butter.  
4. Cut into diamond shapes with a sharp knife and bake for 50 minutes until golden brown.  
5. In a saucepan, combine sugar, water, lemon juice, and honey, simmer for 10 minutes. Pour the hot syrup over the baklava as soon as it comes out of the oven. Let it cool before serving.  

**Section 3: Serving Suggestions**  
- Serve the Vegetarian Moussaka warm, garnished with fresh parsley if desired. Pair it with a light red wine like Agiorgitiko.  
- The Greek Salad can be served in a large bowl for sharing or in individual portions, with a side of crusty bread.  
- Present the Baklava on a platter, with a pot of Greek coffee or mint tea to complement the sweetness of the dessert.  

**Section 4: Explanation of Replaced Ingredients**  
- The ground lamb or beef in the Moussaka was replaced with canned chickpeas to maintain a hearty texture and provide protein, making the dish vegetarian while retaining its essence.  
- The milk in the béchamel sauce was substituted with plant-based milk to offer a dairy-free option, which is suitable for those who prefer plant-based diets.  
- Vegan feta is suggested as an alternative in the Greek Salad to cater to individuals who avoid animal products entirely.  
- Plant-based butter is recommended for the Baklava to ensure the dessert is completely vegetarian-friendly.

Enjoy your delicious and healthy vegetarian Greek dinner!
