**Vegetarian Greek Dinner Recipe: Greek Stuffed Peppers with Quinoa and Feta**

*Serves: 5 people*

**Ingredients:**

- 5 large bell peppers (any color)
- 1 cup quinoa, rinsed
- 2 cups vegetable broth (or water)
- 1 medium onion, chopped
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 medium zucchini, diced
- 1 medium carrot, diced
- 1 cup cherry tomatoes, halved
- 1 teaspoon dried oregano
- 1 teaspoon dried thyme
- 1 teaspoon paprika
- Salt and pepper to taste
- 1 cup crumbled feta cheese (or a vegan feta alternative)
- 1/4 cup fresh parsley, chopped (for garnish)
- Olive oil for sautéing
- Lemon wedges (for serving)

**Preparation Instructions:**

1. **Preheat the Oven**: Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).

2. **Prepare the Quinoa**: In a medium saucepan, combine the rinsed quinoa and vegetable broth. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer for about 15 minutes or until the quinoa is fluffy and the liquid is absorbed. Remove from heat and set aside.

3. **Sauté the Vegetables**: In a large skillet, heat a tablespoon of olive oil over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and minced garlic, sautéing until softened (about 3-4 minutes). Add the diced zucchini and carrot, cooking for an additional 5 minutes until they are just tender. Stir in the halved cherry tomatoes, oregano, thyme, paprika, salt, and pepper. Cook for another 2-3 minutes until the tomatoes start to soften.

4. **Combine the Filling**: In a large bowl, combine the cooked quinoa with the sautéed vegetables and crumbled feta cheese. Mix well to combine and adjust seasoning if necessary.

5. **Prepare the Peppers**: Cut the tops off the bell peppers and remove the seeds. If necessary, trim the bottoms slightly to ensure they stand upright. Place the peppers in a baking dish.

6. **Stuff the Peppers**: Fill each bell pepper with the quinoa and vegetable mixture, packing it down gently. Drizzle a little olive oil over the stuffed peppers.

7. **Bake**: Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil and bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an additional 10-15 minutes, or until the peppers are tender and slightly charred.

8. **Serve**: Remove from the oven and let cool slightly. Garnish with fresh parsley and serve with lemon wedges on the side for a zesty finish.

**Serving Suggestions**: Enjoy the stuffed peppers warm, accompanied by a side of Greek salad (cucumber, tomatoes, olives, and red onion dressed with olive oil and lemon) or whole grain pita bread. This dish is not only satisfying but also colorful and packed with nutrients, making it a delightful vegetarian version of a traditional Greek meal. 

With this recipe, you can enjoy a healthy, delicious, and vibrant Greek dinner that is easy to prepare and sure to impress your family and friends!
