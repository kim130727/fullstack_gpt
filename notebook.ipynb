      "\n",
      "**Section 4: Explanation of Replaced Ingredients**  \n",
      "- The ground lamb or beef in the Moussaka was replaced with canned chickpeas to maintain a hearty texture and provide protein, making the dish vegetarian while retaining its essence.  \n",
      "- The milk in the béchamel sauce was substituted with plant-based milk to offer a dairy-free option, which is suitable for those who prefer plant-based diets.  \n",
      "- Vegan feta is suggested as an alternative in the Greek Salad to cater to individuals who avoid animal products entirely.  \n",
      "- Plant-based butter is recommended for the Baklava to ensure the dessert is completely vegetarian-friendly.\n",
