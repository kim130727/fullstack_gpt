On a clean surface or in a large mixing bowl, pour the flour and create a well in the center.\\n2. Crack the eggs into the well and add the salt.\\n3. Using a fork or your fingers, gradually mix the eggs and salt into the flour, incorporating a little at a time.\\n4. Once the dough starts to come together, knead it with your hands until it forms a smooth and elastic ball. If the dough is too dry, you can add a little water, one tablespoon at a time, until it reaches the desired consistency.\\n5. Once the dough is formed, cover it with a clean kitchen towel or plastic wrap and let it rest for about 30 minutes. This allows the gluten to relax and makes the dough easier to roll out.\\n6. After resting, divide the dough into smaller portions. Take one portion and flatten it with your hands.\\n7. Using a rolling pin, roll out the dough on a lightly floured surface until it is thin and even. You can also use a pasta machine to roll out the dough if you have one.\\n8. Once the dough is rolled out, you can cut it into your desired pasta shape. For example, you can cut it into thin strips for spaghetti or wider strips for fettuccine. You can also use a pasta machine to cut the dough into different shapes.\\n9. After cutting the pasta, you can cook it immediately in a large pot of salted boiling water for about 2-3 minutes, or until al dente. Alternatively, you can let the pasta dry for a few hours or overnight before cooking.\\n10. Once cooked, drain the pasta and serve it with your favorite sauce or toppings.\\n\\nEnjoy your homemade Italian pasta!\",\n",
